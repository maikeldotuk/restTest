# restTest
This is the **RestAPI behind www.maikel.uk**
I can't share it because my password is on it. 

For now the Angular UI and the REST API are here in a single thing. But it won't be like that for long. As once I add routing to the Angular website it'll be incompatible with this. I think. 

UPDATE:
Now I can share it because I've learnt how to use require('myPass'), put my files in a different file and configure .gitignore to not share them. Yay!

So now this repo is public
